        The design prompt for this project called for <b>furniture for small spaces</b>.
        A key requirement was to use of a single 4-foot square of plywood.
        The college student, who is extremely limited in space, was chosen as a
        target user. The frequent moves a college student makes means that
        <b>portability</b> is key.
      </p>
      <p>
        CAD was used in conjunction with laser cutting to make scale foamcore
        prototypes. At this scale, the thickness of the foamcore matches the
        plywood. The final design was cut on a CNC router with hand-cut miters
        for biscuit joining.

        Panda is an adjustable-height bedside table designed for easy
        transportation. Steel pegs hold the upper compartment and tabletop in
        place at one of <b>three different heights</b> to match a variety of
        beds.
      </p>
      <p>
        College students need furniture that takes up minimal space and can be
        moved easily. To accommodate this, the legs and shelf disassemble and
        <b>can be packed into the upper compartment</b>. The box form factor is easy
        to pack and transport.

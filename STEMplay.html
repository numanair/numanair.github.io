        This 3D-printable puzzle toy encourages STEM Play through a system of
        special blocks. <b>Powered only by gravity</b>, this offline toy creates a
        system similar to the internal logic of a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marble Logic is a STEM toy to encourage logical thinking through play.
        <br>
        At <b>age 8</b> kids are already:
        <ul>
          <li><span>Exposed to the concepts of <b>STEM</b> (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)</span></li>
          <li><span>Familiar with stacking blocks</span></li>
          <li><span>Mature enough to handle small parts safely</span></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3D printing</b> is becoming more accessible through libraries, makerspaces and
        schools. This enables rapid distributed production, enhancing access through its
        open nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The percentage of students reaching <b>proficiency in STEM has faltered</b> in recent
        years. STEM Play encourages logical thinking, enabling better learning of these
        concepts in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kids spend more time tapping at screens than ever before. Playing with a
        <b>tactile, kinetic toy</b> subtly teaches about how the physical world behaves. This
        improves manual dexterity and fine motor control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Toggle Blocks and AND Blocks work like mechanical "OR" and "AND" logic
        gates. Path Blocks assist in directing marbles to the desired Goal Blocks
        attached to the baseplate. Each card depicts the requirements for each
        puzzle, with varied difficulty.
